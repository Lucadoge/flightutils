# *Personal Data*
Our definition of 'personal data' is based on the privacy laws and regulations of the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These are widely regarded as the strongest privacy protections in the world. We consider any information about you or your behavior that can be traced back to you as personal data.

### Our privacy policy is really simple: This app **does not** collect nor store user or telemetry data - we can not track your usage in any way.
